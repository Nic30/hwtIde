class LayerSweepCrossingMinimizer():
    """
    This class minimizes crossings by sweeping through a graph,
    holding the order of nodes in one layer fixed and switching the nodes
    in the other layer. After each re-sorting step, the ports in the two
    current layers are sorted.

    By using a LayerSweepTypeDecider as called by the GraphInfoHolder
    initializing class, each graph can either be dealt with bottom-up
    or hierarchically.

    bottom-up: the nodes of a child graph are sorted, then the order
        of ports of hierarchy border traversing edges are fixed.
        Then the parent  graph is laid out, viewing the child graph
        as an atomic node.

    hierarchical: When reaching a node with a child graph marked
        as hierarchical: First the ports are sorted on the outside
        of the graph. Then the nodes on the inside are sorted
        by the order of the ports. Then the child graph is swept through.
        Then the ports of the parent node are sorted by the order of the nodes
        on the last layer of the child graph. Finally the sweep through
        the parent graph is continued.

    Therefore this is a hierarchical processor which must have access
    to the root graph.

    understanding of hierarchical system structures. IEEE Transactions
    on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 11(2):109â€“125, February 1981.

    Precondition:
    The graph has a proper layering, i.e. all long edges have been splitted;
    all nodes have at least fixed port sides.

    Postcondition:
    The order of nodes in each layer and the order of ports in each node
    are optimized to yield as few edge crossings as possible
